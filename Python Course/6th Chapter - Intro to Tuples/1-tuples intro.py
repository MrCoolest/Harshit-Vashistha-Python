#tuple data structure
#tuple can store any data type
#most imortant tuples are immutable, once tuple are created you can't uptade it
# data inside tuple

example= ('one','two','three')
#no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
days = ('Monday','tuesday')
#tuples are faster than lists

# method
# count , index
# len function
# slicing
example[0]=1
print(example) #it give error cuz tuples are immutable
